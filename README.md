This is my local copy of the already installed code of Home Assistant HACS integration for Electrolux devices.
Apparently, the original author got threatened by Electrolux with legal actions - similar to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayG7o74kdbc, I guess.
While the original creator did not share any details, it seems very similar in all spaects.
